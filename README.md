# SkilletUI

A work-in-progress UI engine for LOVE2D, intended for implementation into OpenSMCE at some point!

## What's Done

- Nodes
- Widgets attached to Nodes (texts, boxes, sprites, primitive buttons) with some robust functionality
- Node creation, duplication, removal, ordering, parenting
- Node and widget manipulation with a list of properties, almost all of which are editable
- Project and layout loading and saving
- Fully functional undo/redo stack with working transactions/groups that will be undone at once
- Layout grid and viewport scaling
- Preview mode
- Simple timeline support

## What's To Do

- Timeline support (loading, saving, editing, etc.)
- More yet unknown features
- Integration into OpenSMCE

## About

There is a series of demo layouts which explains the UI decently for now. This section will be filled in at some point...
